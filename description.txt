~~For Summon-type weapon, damage will increase on ALL currently summoned minion/sentry ONLY when you hold summon-type weapon with upgraded stats.  ~~ X

^ Removed these limitations because why imposing hardcoded limit if you have **SELF RESTRAIN.**

Note: - Might incompatible with any reforging method, use Resetter item first before you reforge.  
      - Item that changes upon being right-clicked (Example: Thor's Hammer from Thorium mod) cannot be upgraded and will glitch itself if doing so. **You have been warned**.
